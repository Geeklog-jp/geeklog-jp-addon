<p class="subheading">Summary of features:

<li>Support for Readonly Forums - example FAQ use
<li>Support for RSS Feeds - now with enhanced formatting and rich content
<li>Advanced Moderation features like splitting topics, moving, making sticky
<li>Integrated BBcode supports using text mode and bbcode tags to format content
<li>Able to now safely just use <b>text</b> mode for posting and still use bbocode and advanced formatting features
<li>Enhanced Code Formatting using the Geshi library
<li>Automatic notification support for complete forums or topics. Able subscribe to a forum but then selectively un-subscribe to topics
<li>Member listing page - able to view all members or just those with forum activity
<li>Centerblock for site frontpage or sideblock for users to monitor new posts
<li>Support for autotags in topic content and can reference other forum topics using an autotag [forum: topicid]
<li>Integrated SPAMX and content filtering
<li>Integrated support for Captcha 2.0
<li>Integration opion with glMessenger for member private messaging and online smilie admin
<li>Easy online admin administration and member control of user preferences
</ul>
</p>

<p class="subheading">Summary of version 2.6 changes
<ul>
<li>Support for Register Globals off and MySql 5
<li>Major template changes to provide a much cleaner and better organized layout. Hopefully also allowing easier themeing. Templates are more structured
<li>Performance improvements with the addition of new fields to save frequent database lookups. Sites updating can use the Admin->Forums page and the Re-Sync feature to update the new fields
<li>Completely replacement of bbcode and content formatting to use a new bbcode class
<div style="padding:5px 10px 2px 20px;"><b>StringParser_BBCode</b> from Christian Seiler: http://www.christian-seiler.de/projekte/php/bbcode/index_en.html</div>
<div style="padding:0px 10px 5px 20px;">Much appreciated the efforts of Mark Evans for re-working the code to support this new class</div>
<li>Enhanced RSS Feed supporting rich content - Mark Evans
<li>Enhanced print feature - Mark Evans
<li>Integrated support for the Captcha 2.0 plugin - Mark Evans
<li>Using a function to now auto-detect the image type to use for the main layout related images. Will default to the image type defined in the {themes}/functions.php - the $_IMAGE_TYPE. If the image is not found, then it will use the 2nd option as defined in the plugins/forum/config.php - default to 'gif'. This allows a site to have some png images and some gif images and not have to edit the templates
<li>The links that are used for items like [subscribe], [print], [new topic] ... and the ones that are shown in a topic like the member [profile], [website],[email] can now easily be themed to use a choice of images, basic links or rollover like CSS button. Each link has it's own template under the template forum/layout/links subfolder. 
I have commented a few and also created a couple CSS Button examples in the Have a look at layout/links/rollover_examples 
Have a look at print.thtml - and see how that can easily be changed to an icon
<li>Added new option for Edit <b>[Silent]</b> post feature. Notifications will not be sent out and timestamp are not changed if this option used
<li>Removed un-necessary inclusion of forum ID in links
<li>Hopefully removed all hard-coded language - moved to LANGUAGE files
<li>Able to use a site setting of 0 for the Edit Timeframe allowing members to always edit their own posts
<li>Fixed bugs with moderation, notification features, admininstration and page layout
<li>Better handling of formatting post content for Edit mode - revert back smilies, quoting and code syntax
<li>Removed support for the MSN and other IM links in the topic, the MSN JS required a ActiveX object and was IE only
<li>Fixed issues with handling complex content containing backslashes and quotes
</ul>

<p class="sectionheading" style="margin-bottom:0px;"><a name="_installation">1) How to Install</a></p>
<p class="attention" style="margin-top:5px;">You need to manually create the plugins program directories and copy the files to their appropriate directories.</p>
<p style="padding:20px;">If you are new to installing a geeklog plugin, I recommend that you review the background documentation on how to install a plugin <a href="http://wiki.geeklog.net/index.php/Plugins">here</a></p>
<p>Step 0 - Backup your Database
<ul>
<li>Make a backup of your current 
geeklog database using the built-in admin feature. Verify your backup feature is 
configured correctly and backup file is not 0 bytes. <span class="attention">This is worth the time to verify your backup</span>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Step 1 - Restore the plugin Archive
<ul>
<li>Uncompress the archive files into your &lt;geeklog_dir&gt;/plugins directory. It will create a forum subdirectory for the files.
</ul>
</p>

<p>Step 2 - Create the required plugin directories
<ul>
<li>Create a directory called <b>forum</b> under your public_html directory
<li>Create a directory called <b>forum</b> under your public_html/admin/plugins directory
</ul>
</p>

<p>Step 3 - Copy the the required plugin files
<ul>
<li>Copy the files (contents) from the new plugin's public_html directory to the <b>forum</b> directory you just created under your sites main public_html directory
<li>Copy the files (contents) from the new plugin's admin directory to the <b>forum</b> directory you just created under your sites main public_html/admin/plugins directory
</ul>
</p>

<p>Step 4 - Copy the the required theme files
<ul>
<li>Copy the directory called <b>forum</b> and contents from the new plugin's themefiles directory to your sites theme's directory. Assuming your site is running the <i>professional</i> theme this  would be <i>public_html/layout/professional</i>. You would then copy the themefiles/forum directry from the plugin archive so that you create a <i>professional/forum</i> directory with all the new layout files from the plugin archive
</ul>
</p>

<p>Step 5 - Update or copy the lib-portalparts.php file
<ul>
<li>The plugins from portalparts use a number of common functions that are placed in the lib-portalparts.php file. Copy the file from the plugin archive to your system folder where there are other lib-xxxxx.php files
</ul>
</p>

<p>Step 6 - Run the plugin install
<ul>
<li>Logged in as 'admin' you can access the installer from the plugin editor [<i>admin -> plugins</i>]
<li>If the files have been copied correctly in step 3 and 4, you will see the new plugin to be installed
</ul>
</p>

<p>Step 7 - Update your themes css - <i>style.css</i> file
<ul>
<li><blockquote>The forum is using the plugin CSS that is distributed with the GL 1.4.1 professional theme. If you are running a GL 1.4.1 site and using the stock professional theme or a 1.4.1 certified theme, you will only need to add a few new CSS styles <i>declarations</i> for the codeblock and quote formatting feature.</blockquote>
<li>If you have a GL 1.4 site or using a beta release of GL 1.4.1, then update style.css file using the <b>pre1.4.1_forum.css</b> file in the archive under the themefiles folder. Backup your current style.css file for reference and for many sites, they can just replace all the plugin like CSS declarations. They should all be grouped together in your style.css file.
<li>Pre 1.4.1 themes will also need to add missing navbar images. Add the images found in archives themefiles/navbar/images folder to the same folder under your site's theme.<br>Add the CSS declarations from the <b>forum.css</b> file in the archive under the themefiles folder.<br><br>
<li>If you have a GL 1.4.1 final site, then you will only need to add the few additional CSS styles for the codeblock and quote formatting.<br>Add the CSS declarations from the <b>forum.css</b> file in the archive under the themefiles folder.<br>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Step 8 - Setup your forums and review Admin Settings
<ul>
<li>Create atleast one category which will contain one or more forums
<li>Create a forum within this category. A forum will then contain many topics which are created by your community of users. The forums are created and so named to organize your topics.
<li>The forums can be setup to be restricted to site-members only or public access as well other options can be set to control the access to the forums
<li>Review the optional plugin <a href="#_config">config.php settings</a>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="sectionheading" style="margin-bottom:0px;"><a name="_update">2) How to update from version 2.5RC3</a></p>
<p>Step 0 - Backup your Database.
<ul>
<li>Make a backup of your current geeklog database using the built-in admin feature. Verify your backup feature is 
configured correctly and backup file is not 0 bytes. <div class="attention">The backup is strongly recommended. The update will need to modify your database. Additionally, incase there are any formatting issues with your forum content after the update, you may want to have the option of going back</div>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Step 1 - Disable the forum plugin (optional)
<p class="attention" style="margin-top:5px;padding-left:25px;">Note: A bug in GL 1.4.1 pre-release may create a SQL error when toggling the enable/disable of the plugin. If this occurs - skip this step and leave it enabled.</p>
<ul>
<li>From the Plugin Editor <b>Admin > plugins</b>, disable the forum plugin so any current site users will not be accessing the forum during the update. This is an optional step and not required.
</ul>
</p>
<p>Step 2 - Restore the plugin Archive
<ul>
<li>Uncompress the archive files into your &lt;geeklog_dir&gt;/plugins directory. You will need to replace all the files and some directories and files are no longer needed.
<li>Update all your sites main public_html/forum files. Suggest you delete current files and copy over the new files
<li>Update all your sites main public_html/admin/plugins/forum files. Suggest you delete current files and copy over the new files
<li>Update all your sites main public_html/layout/{theme}/forum files. Suggest you delete current files and copy over the new files
</ul>
</p>
<p>Step 3 - Run the plugin update
<p class="attention" style="margin-top:5px;padding-left:25px;">Note: If the forum was still enabled, the centerblock and sideblock will be disabled once you copy over the new code until you complete the plugin update</p>
<ul>
<li>Access the plugin update from the Plugin Editor. The plugin listing will show version 2.5RCx is installed and that an update is recommended. Using the Edit link by the plugin record, access the edit screen where there will now be an <b>update</b> button. Pressing [Update] will execute the needed database changes
<li>Run the <b>Forum Re-Sync</b> admin feature to complete the update of the new forum fields. From the Admim->Forum screen, access the admin section for <i>forums</i>. You will see that you can Re-Sync each forum or all forums for a category.
<blockquote>This is a manual task because initial testing on large forums found that an automated update on a site with a large number of forums and possiby thousands of posts per forum could exceed the max-execution time allowed on your webserver</blockquote>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Step 4 - Update your themes css - <i>style.css</i> file
<ul>
<li><blockquote>The forum is using the plugin CSS that is distributed with the GL 1.4.1 professional theme. If you are running a GL 1.4.1 site and using the stock professional theme or a 1.4.1 certified theme, you will only need to add a few new CSS styles <i>declarations</i> for the codeblock and quote formatting feature.</blockquote>

<li>If you have a GL 1.4.1 final site, then you will only need to add the few additional CSS styles for the codeblock and quote formatting.<br>Add the CSS declarations from the <b>forum.css</b> file in the archive under the themefiles folder.<br>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Step 5 - Review Admin Settings
<ul>
<li>Review the admin settings
<li>Review the optional plugin <a href="#_config">config.php settings</a>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Congradulations - you should now have your forum updated to version 2.6</p>
</p>

<p class="sectionheading" style="margin-bottom:0px;"><a name="_update">3) How to update from version 2.3.x</a></p>
<p class="attention" style="margin-top:5px;padding-left:25px;">The update process will update your forum to version 2.6 in one step if version 2.3.x detected</p>
<p>Step 0 - Backup your Database.

<p class="sectionheading" style="margin-bottom:0px;"><a name="_theming">4) Theming the plugin look</a></p>
<p>The plugin uses the new default plugin CSS declarations that were introduced in GL 1.4. Example of the main CSS decalarations used are:
<ul>
<li>.pluginRow1 and .pluginRow2 for the alternating file listing records<blockquote>More detail planned</blockquote>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The templates were copied to your theme directory - folder <i>/forum/layout</i> directory
<ul>
<li>Main templates are in the top level layout folder
<li>Templates for the centerblock and sideblock are located in the <i>blocks </i> subfolder
<li>The forum footer related templates are located in the <i>footer</i> subfolder
<li>Templates for most of the links like [new topic], [reply], [profile], [email] etc are themed using the templates under the <i>links</i> subfolder. It's possible to change these links to use images, CSS like buttons etc.
<li>Templates for pages that show a report if newposts, members, subscriptions  etc are located in the <i>reports</i> folder

<p class="sectionheading" style="margin-bottom:0px;"><a name="_config">5) Config.php Settings</a></p>

<p>Most of the common forum settings are now online settings but there are additional settings in the plugins config.php file
<ul>
<li>$CONF_FORUM['mysql4+']<div style="padding-left:20px;">Set to <b>true</b> if your server is running MySQL 4.x or later. Doing so will use optimized SQL queries and will improve performance.</div>
