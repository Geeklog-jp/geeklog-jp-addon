File changes between 2.6RC4 and 2.6Final
The following changes and bug fixes have been addressed in RC5 (Final 2.6 version release)

x Fixed issue where the Gravatar images were not being displayed
x Forum admin -> Delete Category now shows if category has no forums
x Added rel=nofollow to temporary links like latest topic
x Fixed small layout issue with Topic heading
x Added Re-Sync of Forum topic when using the story migrate feature to update counters
x Fixed several issues with Move Topic and move post feature - update last post info related
x Fixed issue where "View New Posts" would not appear
x Fixed issue with the View New Posts report
x Added advanced search types to plugin search feature [Mark Evans]
x Re-Sync the forum now after migrating stories to the forum to update forum indexes.
x Removed hopefully all the places the forum id was being passed in links - just need topic id
x Disabled error reporting on all calls to the PHP Function htmlspecialchars. 
  Eliminates the error that was being reported by htmlspecialchars() when using ISO-8859-9 which is not one of the allowed charsets.
  Found that if you put a @ infront of the htmlspecialchars() call, it will default back to ISO-8859-1 and not report
x Added missing language message displayed when you upgraded the plugin
