Install/Uninstall instruction for the Geeklog {plugin} plugin.

INSTALL:

Step 1:  Back up your Geeklog Database.  The {plugin} plugin adds tables to your Geeklog database.  You can do
this with the built in admin backup facility.

Step 2:  Uncompress the {plugin} plugin archive while in the <geeklog_dir>/plugins directory.  The archive will
create a directory called {plugin} in the plugins directory.

Step 3:  Create the public_html and admin directories.  Under your html directory (usually public_html) 
create a directory called {plugin}.  Under your admin/plugins/ directory create a directory called {plugin}.

Step 4:  Change to your <geeklog_dir>/plugins/{plugin}/ directory.  Copy the files in the admin directory 
to the admin/plugins/{plugin}/ directory your created in step 3.  Copy the files and directories in the 
public_html directory to the public_html/{plugin}/ directory your created in step 3.

Step 5:  Edit the config.php in the {plugin} directory and confirm the table prefix and anonymous access 
settings and other display settings.  The default is to use the geeklog table prefix and not allow 
anonymous access.

Step 6:  Log in to your Geeklog as a root user and run install.php in your admin/plugins/{plugin}/ directory.
The install page will tell you if the install was successful or not.  If not examine Geeklog system errorlog
for possible problems.

The {plugin} plugin should now be installed and functioning.  Clicking on the {plugin} Icon will
take you to the admin page.  

Step 7: Set up security.  On install only the root users have access to {plugin} administration and Viewing.  
You can delegate control for either of these functions through the user and group editors.

UNINSTALL:

Step 1:  Run the install.php page in your admin/plugins/{plugin} directory.  This will remove all the data from
your database.

Step 2:  Delete the three plugin directories created in the install process:  <geeklog-dir>plugins/{plugin}/ 
<public_html>/{plugin}/ and <admin>/plugins/{plugin}/

That's it.
